# Machine Learning Playground

This repo contains all of the small projects I create to experiment with and improve my skills and knowledge of machine learning. Note that I do not use 'AI' to generate any of the logic inside of this repo, as the entire purpose is for me to learn and understand the principles of what is happening both architecturally and fundamentally.
